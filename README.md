## Abstract
This paper presents Bullseye, a web-based stock market visualization and prediction service that leverages machine learning and deep learning algorithms to provide users with real-time market data, customizable visualizations, and predictive analytics. The service is designed to help investors make informed investment decisions by identifying investment opportunities based on forecasted market trends. To evaluate the effectiveness of Bullseye, various LSTM models were trained and tested on 5-year historical closing stock market data from Apple. The best-performing model achieved a validation RMSE of 5.34 and a validation R2 value of 0.71. The results
demonstrate the potential of Bullseye to improve prediction accuracy and provide valuable insights into market trends. Overall, Bullseye offers a user-friendly web interface and a continuously updated algorithm to help investors gain valuable insights into the stock market and make informed investment decisions.
